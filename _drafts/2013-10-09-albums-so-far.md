There's been a wave of great new music in the last few months,
whole albums that I can't put down, and I wanted to throw them into a list.
Most of these albums were released in the last few months
or are to be released shortly. Not all of them are phenomenal,
but each is worth your time.

### On Repeat

- [Range: Nonfiction](http://donkypitch.bandcamp.com/releases)
  - Drop everything and put this on. If you have a good system, turn it up.
    I didn't click with this album on my first listen, which was in headphones,
    but space and volume are it needed. This is one of my favorite albums of the year.
- [The Field: Cupid's Head](http://www.kompakt.fm/releases/cupids_head_2xlp_cd)
- [Youth Code: s/t](http://youthcode.bandcamp.com/album/youth-code)
  - Leaving their best track, &#8220;[Tiger's&nbsp;Remorse](http://youthcode.bandcamp.com/track/tigers-remorse)&#8221;,
    off the LP was a mistake. That said, this is a killer debut, and another of my favorite albums of 2013.
- [Four Tet: Beautiful Rewind](https://bleep.com/release/45467-four-tet-beautiful-rewind)
- [Oneohtrix Point Never: R Plus Seven](https://bleep.com/release/44656-oneohtrix-point-never-r-plus-seven)
- [Mark McGuire: The Instinct 12"]()
- [Laurel Halo: Chance of Rain](https://bleep.com/release/46658-laurel-halo-chance-of-rain)
- [Tim Hecker: Virgins](https://bleep.com/release/45776-tim-hecker-virgins)
- [Tessela: Nancy's Pantry](http://randsrecords.greedbag.com/buy/nancys-pantry-1/)
  - Hard and slow.
- [New York Transit Authority: Swarm](https://soundcloud.com/lobsterboyrecords/new-york-transit-authority)
- [Huerco S.: Untitled](http://opaltapes.bandcamp.com/album/huerco-s-untitled)
  - Ok, not new, but new to me.
- [Sophie: Bipp](https://soundcloud.com/msmsmsm/sophie-bipp)
  - Promised to make me feel better; did. For my money, &#8220;Bipp&#8221;
    is one of the best tracks of the year.

#### Not new or on repeat all the time, but still good

- [Not Waving: Redacted](http://boomkat.com/cassettes/796607-not-waving-redacted)
- [Carter Tutti: Coolicon](https://boomkat.com/downloads/711324-carter-tutti-coolicon)
  - I'll fall for anything they release.
- [Fauve: Blizzard](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/blizzard/id632722469)
  - &#8220;Kane&#8221; is high on my list of tracks for the year. I was floored the first time I&nbsp;heard&nbsp;it.
    This EP doesn't disappoint.

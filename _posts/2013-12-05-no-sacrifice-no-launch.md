Yesterday, I gave quick talk at Starter League about what
new-to-the-game developers can expect once they leave the
friendly confines of their program. The talk itself
was a sort of list of things I'd like everyone
coming into this world to know. These points were generalities,
but not a single one insincere.

The point that I think resonated the most was that
<strong>without sacrifice, there is no launch.</strong>
You must learn when to let go, and let go live.
I'm really not one for mantras, but this was a lesson
hard learned in my professional experience, and I'm a far
better developer for having learned it.

The tenant of this idea is that, as developers, we're the gatekeepers
of the project(s). That means it's in some way (or completely)
in our hands and minds to say whether or not something is ready to go.
We're also a breed prone to indulging ourselves in
unnecessary work with an ill-defined pay-off,
such as delaying launch to add just one more feature
or swapping out parts for something edgier, newer.

In reality, we're conning ourselves into thinking that
the (latest and greatest) lightbulb that just turned on is the light at
the end of the tunnel.

Learning how to make sacrifices is key to any developer's growth because
learning to make sacrifices is learning how to *manage*. Without this,
there is no launch and there is no iterate;
there is only regret. Or, you're the person always talking about
their ideas with nothing to show for them.

So, please, while you're planning your app or while you're in the thick of it,
devote time to thinking critically about what you do not need.
Don't cut everything and launch a weak product&mdash;no one will take your
anemic functionality and default Bootstrap skin seriously. Just think
&#8220;is this feature and time-debt I'll take on *reasonable* or *essential* to
take this live?&#8221; That question is as valid for 0.1 as it is for
1.0, 2.0, and so on.

Learn to focus on the work that means the most. Embrace quality,
but also embrace the sanity that iteration allows.

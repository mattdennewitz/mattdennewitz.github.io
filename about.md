I'm Matt. I live in Chicago where I head up an otherwise
brilliant engineering team at [Pitchfork](http://pitchfork.com).
We've done some [pretty](http://pitchfork.com/features/cover-story/)
[interesting](http://thedissolve.com)
[work](http://nothingmajor.com/),
and I'll be talking about that from time to time,
in terms of our philosophies of development and experience,
and simply about code. And, y'know, about new music and
new music technology.

In 2012, I co-founded a site 
with [Eno Sarris](http://enosarris.wordpress.com/)
called [BeerGraphs](http://beergraphs.com/),
which looks at the analytics and culture of beer with data from around the web.
BeerGraphs is loosely associated with a far more popular site
(as you may have guessed) called [FanGraphs](http://fangraphs.com/).
BeerGraphs has a daily stream of great writing,
and we've come up with a beer scoring metric called
[*Beers Above Replacement*](http://beergraphs.com/bg/5-welcome-to-beergraphs/).
BAR is modeled after what the Sabermetrics-inclined call Wins Above Replacement.
Check out our [leaderboards](http://beergraphs.com/leaderboards/)
to slice, dice, and filter your favorite beers, breweries, styles, and more.

In Fall of 2013, I'll (finally) be launching a new project
called Saber Archive, an index of modern Sabermetric research.
The organization of past and present Sabermetric research is suffering
from its own explosive growth. Saber Archive is an attempt
at organizing and indexing with an eye towards preservation.

I try to open source what I can. You can [fork my projects](http://github.com/mattdennewitz)
to add more tests and `setup.py`. When not pushing text around a screen,
I'm probably watching baseball, geeking out about monospace fonts,
or shooting equal parts whiskey and pool with my wife, Melissa.

And this is my blog.
